## Introduction
This study investigates the relationship between total evaporation and the dual influence of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on global and regional scales. The dominant influence of ENSO on several climate variables is widely recognized. By combining the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the phase change of the El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can be accelerated, leading to the emergence of distinct global teleconnection patterns (Ham et al., 2017). The geographical locations of ENSO and IOD also overlap their effects in regions such as Australia, Indonesia, and certain parts of Africa. In this study, I quantified the individual and combined impacts of ENSO and IOD on global evaporation patterns. Also, I identified a region (Australia) most sensitive to these dual influences.

ENSO is the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly in the central and equatorial Pacific Ocean. I used the Nino 3.4 index to identify El Nino, La Nina, and Neutral phases. According to NCEI, NOAA El Nino (La Nina) is a phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean where the SST anomalies in the NiÃ±o 3.4 region are consistently above (below) the threshold of +0.5Â°C (-0.5Â°C) for five consecutive 3-month periods. Whereas the IOD is the difference in SST between the equatorial western and eastern parts of the Indian Ocean. I used the Dipole Mode Index (DMI) to identify the Positive (DMI>0.2), Negative (DMI<0.2), and Neutral Phases of IOD. 

I chose the FLUXCOM xBase Dataset for its high spatial and temporal resolution, essential for accurately analyzing evaporation patterns influenced by the ENSO and the IOD. Its comprehensive global coverage is also crucial for examining the widespread impacts of these climatic phenomena. 

## Data

### Primary Dataset: Evaporation
To generate the FLUXCOM dataset, researchers from the Max Planck Institutes for Biogeochemistry used machine learning techniques; specifically the upscaling approach to combine in-situ observations, satellite remote sensing, and meteorological data.

#### ðŸ’¾ Zarr Format
"*Zarr is a format tailored for **chunked**, **compressed**, and **N-dimensional arrays**. It serves both as a storage and computational format to efficiently manage large datasets.*" More details can be found in the [official documentation](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

#### ðŸ“‚ Zarr Data Structure
Zarr employs a hierarchical storage model, similar to directories and files in a traditional file system:
- **Group**: The top-level container that can include other `groups` or `arrays`.
- **Array**: A N-dimensional chunked array within a `group`.
- **Metadata**: Stored in a human-readable JSON format.
- **Data Chunks**: Often compressed and stored as binary blobs.

### Climate Indices: NINO 3.4

- **Spatial Coverage**: Central Equatorial Pacific, between 5Â°N - 5Â°S and 170Â°W - 120Â°W

| Seasonal Changes of Evaporation | Here in the notebook refers to the assingment 01. I showed the seasonal changes of evaporation over period 2001 to 2003. Ingore the metadata like units. | [View Notebook](https://github.com/tasanyphy01773/CLIM680/blob/main/Assingment01_680.ipynb)

In my reports, I performed various analysis including aggregation of data for mean, standard deviation, calculating climatologies by month and seasons, and determining anomalies. I also conducted composite analysis with Nino 3.4 and DMI, created composite anomaly plots with statistical significance, and developed custom Python functions for specific data operations. Additionally, I calculated and plotted the temporal correlation coefficient between the gridded data and ENSO, providing insightful views into the evaporation and the dual driver climate patterns and relationships.

## Results
### Evaporation
We are now looking at the monthly mean evaporation from 2001 to 2003 (Figure 01). Each map uses a color gradient to indicate the rate of evaporation, with the scale provided at the bottom ranging from 0.00 to 0.28 millimeters per hour (mm/hour). Areas near the equator show a consistent presence of high evaporation rates throughout the year, likely due to higher temperatures and more intense sunlight. In contrast, the polar regions  indicates very low evaporation rates, which can be attributed to the cold temperatures and less sunlight

### ENSO and Evaporation 
Figure 02 shows the time when there was El Nino and when there was La Nina. As we are working with a very small time limit, the number of El Nino event (Nino 3.4 index>0.5) was 2 and around 2 La Nina. Where we have very few data from La Nina.

In Figure 03, a composite analysis was conducted, where we can see both in the El Nino and La nina event the increase of the evaporation from the climatological mean (period 2001 to 2004) is prominent than the Neutral phase; where the change is less. This could be we have a lot of data from the neutral event which might give us a wrong interpretition.
